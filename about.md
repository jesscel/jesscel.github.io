HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Enci, an incoming machine learning engineer at Apple.

I got my BS and MS degrees in CS from Stanford University. I was a software engineer intern at Microsft with the Outlook mobile iOS team during the summer of my sophomore year. During my time at Stanford, I also worked with Prof. Chris Re and Prof. Stefano Ermon.

My interests lie in in LLMs, machine learning, and sustainability.
