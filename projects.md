(c)) represents the ground truth building distribution (Subfig. (d)) quite well. In the most ideal case, we want the proposal distribution to be proportional to the ground truth.</em></figcaption>

# Metadata Shaping

Metadata Shaping is a simple and effective approach to enhance LMs with knowledge. The method involves inserting readily available entity metadata into examples based on mutual information, and training on the shaped data.
